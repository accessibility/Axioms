# Axioms
Accessibility axioms: Basic truths about building an inclusive digital world.

- Administrative pages are more likely to have accessibility problems than traditional public facing pages.
It is easier to improve the accessibility in a system with reasonable accessibility than to start with one with unknown number of accessibility issues. 
- All CMS’s are broken into those elements which an editor can control, and those that are managed by the system which developers build, this is similar to how a photo sits in a frame. 
- Authoring experiences can shape the accessibility of their work. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0, Part B is a strong example of this.
- Building with patterns that have previously been tested for accessibility will reduce costs for implementing WCAG. 
- Digital tools will never be 100% accessible, just like it will never be 100% secure. 
- Involving people with lived experience with disability early in the development process will produce more accessible results.
- Accessibility is a team sport. In order to effectively address accessibility issues, we need experience outside of project teams. Collaborative approaches will achieve the best results in the long run.
- Make things open: it makes things better. This is especially true in digital accessibility where everyone is trying to keep up with the internet. 
- The earlier you start incorporating digital accessibility into your digital tool, the less expensive it will be to become accessible (shift left).
- It is more expensive to make a legacy tool accessible than it is to rebuild it on a more accessible platform.
- Software on the internet needs to be seen as a living system. Need to move from leveraging periodic checklists to building an ongoing journey.
- There will always be users who find barriers to their use of the technology. Having an open feedback system will help to identify new accessibility issues. 
- Automated testing is always going to be the most efficient way to find 100% of ~30% of accessibility issues. 
- Some things don’t appear in WCAG, not because they aren’t important, but because they cannot be concisely expressed and defended. Cognitive & learning disabilities are often neglected because it is hard to express as a universally understood success criterion. 
- The more people that champion and apply a lens around accessibility and inclusion the more that organization can scale their efforts, capacity and improve outcomes for people who use their products and services.
- Accessibility will always be easier if a project starts with good, meaningfully structured content written in plain language. Do the hard work of making it easy to understand. 
- Keep it simple. On the web, semantic HTML is the best. Take the time to understand semantics. ARIA can extend HTML, but if not used properly it can make it worse. Only use ARIA if you can’t do it with HTML.
- A champion network within an organization will be more effective than an individual expert.
- Keyboard issues hold about 40% of accessibility failures, and most automated tools do not evaluate for them. Testing for this is simple, and is often overlooked. 
- User-centered design isn’t going to give you as inclusive a result as user-led design. Design with - not for - people with disabilities. 
- WCAG is nothing more than a good start to the larger goal of an inclusive society. Achieving WCAG 2.x AA compliance is good, but insufficient on its own. 
- WCAG isn’t perfect. It is only as good as the people and the community behind it. Creating community guidelines is hard, but a necessary pre-condition to building a common solution. 
- Digital is one service channel. When planning inclusive services ensure that all channels & touchpoints apply an inclusive lens.
- There’s no such thing as an average user and the need for personalization is inevitable. There is no “one-size-fits-all” digital tool that will meet everyone’s needs. Dark Mode is just the beginning.
- Designing for the starburst of humanity, will produce better products and services than first working within the Pareto Principle and then trying to apply WCAG. Design for the fringe.
- Any process involved in creating digital content can impact its accessibility. After it is created, lots of different software is required to deliver it to the end user. Software is rarely built perfectly to a common open standards.
- Without an inclusion lens, digital solutions are brittle. Permanent disabilities hit 15% of the population, but temporary & situational disabilities effect us all. 
- Digital accessibility involves technology, but should not be technocratic. Empathy is required to make good judgements as this is ultimately a human issue. Objectivity is needed to guide judgement, and thus we need to invest in common standards.

Some good ideas should be captured, but are more best practices or patterns, rather than statements of truth that simplify the problem. 

- Include people with disabilities in persona's. 1/6 should have have a permanent disability. The rest should also include some permanent or temporary disability. 
- Design with the people that can't use or have difficulty with your product/service.
- Asking who's missing from the decision-making process & why throughout the proces.
- Don't expect to be able to scale by diversifying there is no formulaic replication.
- iterate to include more needs, not to arrive at one award winning design.
